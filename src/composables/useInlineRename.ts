/**
 * Double-click-to-rename: click a name to enter edit mode, an <input> replaces the label,
 * focuses and selects its text, and blur/Enter commits while Esc cancels. PresetSidebar.vue used
 * to hand-write this twice — once for block names, once for group names — with the two copies
 * differing only in which store field they read/wrote. This composable is that one
 * implementation; each caller instantiates it once per distinct rename target (block names and
 * group names stay two separate instances, since they ARE different things being renamed, not
 * two variations on one state machine — see sidebar-refactor-report.md 四.3's phrasing:
 * "本来就是不同的编辑目标，不需要合并成一个状态机").
 *
 * `getCurrentName`/`onCommit` are callbacks rather than this composable reaching into a store
 * directly, so it stays domain-agnostic — same reasoning as useDragReorder's onDrop being a
 * narrow callback rather than owning any domain-specific interpretation itself.
