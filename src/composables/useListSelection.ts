/**
 * One recognizer + dispatcher for "which selection interaction is this, and what should happen" —
 * shared across every input device a list supports. A plain click, a Ctrl/Cmd+click, a
 * Shift+click, and a mobile long-press are four different GESTURES for arriving at a selection
 * mode, but once the mode is known there's exactly one place that decides what happens next:
 * `onSelect(mode, id)`. No separate "mobile" and "desktop" selection logic, and no separate
 * long-press state machine — long-press just dispatches as `'ctrl'` mode (see onPointerDown's doc
 * comment), so it goes through the exact same `onSelect` path a desktop Ctrl+click does.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT own the actual selection state transition (no `applyMultiSelect` call in
 * here, no `selected`/`anchor` state of its own) — that's supplied by the caller via `onSelect`.
 * presetStore.selectBlock() already wraps applyMultiSelect() correctly for 'ctrl'/'shift', and is
 * called from places other than any one sidebar (search jumps, variable-nav jumps — see
 * PROJECT.md), so it has to stay the single source of truth for that transition. Reimplementing
 * that state machine a second time inside this composable would be the exact kind of duplication
 * this refactor is trying to remove, just moved one level down instead of eliminated. This
 * composable's job ends at "recognize the gesture, call the right handler with the right mode" —
 * see sidebar-refactor-report.md 四.4 step 5's own warning about getting this API wrong by
 * guessing at a fuller surface before there's a second real consumer to validate it against.
 *
 * `'single'` mode is passed through to `onSelect` as-is (not resolved internally) because this
 * app's plain-click behavior is NOT applyMultiSelect's plain-click behavior: this app always
 * selects exactly the clicked/pressed row and never clears the selection on a repeat click,
 * whereas applyMultiSelect's plain-click branch toggles the selection off if you click the sole
 * already-selected item again. That's an existing, deliberate divergence in this codebase (plain
 * clicks also open a tab / toggle a group's collapsed state, which is why they were never routed
 * through applyMultiSelect to begin with) — this composable preserves it rather than silently
 * "fixing" it into consistency with ctrl/shift.
