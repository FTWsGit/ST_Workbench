/**
 * Watches tabsStore.listScrollToken[domain] and scrolls whatever item currently maps to
 * `tabsStore.activeTab.key` into view. Both PresetSidebar and RegexSidebar used to hand-roll
 * their own version of this watch — RegexSidebar always resolved its scroll target from
 * `activeTab.key` (correct), while PresetSidebar scrolled to `store.selectedGi`'s smallest
 * member instead (a leftover from the pre-tabs architecture, where "selected" and "displayed"
 * were the same thing — see sidebar-refactor-report.md 一/1.2 for the full history). Once
 * `selectedGi` and `activeTab` were split into independent state, that assumption silently
 * broke: clicking an already-open tab in TabBar ticks the scroll token but never touches
 * `selectedGi`, so the old PresetSidebar logic scrolled to a stale selection instead of the tab
 * that was just focused.
 *
 * This composable is the structural fix: there is exactly one implementation of "resolve the
 * scroll target from the active tab, then scroll it into view", and every domain's sidebar
 * calls it with a `keyOf()` that converts `activeTab.key` (always a string identifier) into
 * whatever key type that sidebar's itemEls map uses. Regex sidebars use identifiers directly as
 * their key (`keyOf: () => activeTab.key`); block sidebars key their DOM refs by `gi` (a
 * flatNodes index), so they pass `keyOf: () => store.identifierToGi(activeTab.key)`.
 *
 * Only fires while `domain` matches the currently active tab's domain, mirroring both sidebars'
 * previous guard — a scroll-token tick for a different domain (e.g. a regex tab focused while
 * the block scroll token is untouched) should not cause this sidebar to scroll to something
 * stale or unrelated.
