// Tavern Helper runs injected scripts inside an `about:srcdoc` iframe, but this app's UI is
// mounted onto `window.top.document` (see main.ts) so the FAB/panel are visible on the real page.
//
// That split means every bare, unqualified `window`/`document` reference in this codebase
// actually refers to the IFRAME's window/document — NOT the one the visible UI lives in.
// For pure CSS cascade this doesn't matter (styles apply based on the live DOM tree the
// elements were inserted into, regardless of which document created them). But it silently
// breaks anything that binds to the global window/document object directly:
//   - `window.addEventListener('mousemove', ...)` for drag/resize never fires, because the
//     mouse is moving over the top document, not the iframe.
//   - `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)` reads the IFRAME's own <html> tag, which
//     never receives any of our CSS custom properties — always falls back to defaults.
//   - `new ResizeObserver(...)` constructed from the iframe's global may not reliably observe
//     elements that live in a different document.
//
// Everywhere in this app that needs the "real" window/document should go through these
// helpers instead of using the bare globals.

 * about:srcdoc iframe with no `allow` attribute we control, so `navigator.clipboard` can be
 * undefined or `writeText()` can reject with a permissions error. This tries the HOST window's
 * navigator.clipboard first (same document the visible UI/user gesture actually belongs to), then
 * falls back to the legacy execCommand('copy') textarea trick via the host document — that path
 * doesn't go through the Permissions API at all, so it still works in contexts where the Clipboard
 * API itself is blocked. Resolves to false on total failure and logs the real reason to console
 * (the previous call site's `.catch()` swallowed the error entirely, which is why past failures
 * showed nothing in devtools).
