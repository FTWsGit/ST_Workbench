  // inject a <style> tag into the iframe's own document and then cloning it over —

  // Appended to <html> (documentElement), not <body>, AND given its own explicit
  // position:fixed + huge z-index here (inline, so nothing in main.css can accidentally lose
  // this cascade fight) rather than leaving it as a plain unstyled div. This spot used to just
  // rely on being appended after <body> in DOM order to paint on top — that turned out not to
  // be enough. Confirmed by live device testing (not guesswork): in SillyTavern's own mobile
  // theme, <body> itself is made `position:fixed` (a common trick to stop the page shifting
  // when the on-screen keyboard opens/closes). `position:fixed` ALWAYS creates a new stacking
  // context, regardless of z-index — so <body> becomes its own stacking context containing
  // things like the chat's #send_textarea, and a later-in-DOM-order but NON-positioned sibling
  // (which is what this div was before this change) paints in the "in-flow, non-positioned"
  // layer, which is BELOW any positioned stacking context's layer in the CSS painting order —
  // completely independent of which one is later in the DOM. Source order only decides ties
  // WITHIN the same layer. So our own UI was rendering, in the right place, just permanently
  // buried under <body>'s own stacking context (e.g. the chat's #send_textarea), which is why
  // it looked identical to "not rendering at all" or "not clickable".
  //
  // The fix has two parts, both required:
  //  1. `position:fixed` + explicit `width:100vw;height:100vh` (NOT `inset:0`) here on the
  //     OUTERMOST wrapper. `vw`/`vh` units are always resolved against the true visual
  //     viewport, unlike `inset:0`/percentages, which resolve against whatever this element's
  //     *containing block* turns out to be — and per the CSS spec, a `position:fixed`
  //     element's containing block becomes the nearest ancestor with a `transform` set, not
  //     necessarily the viewport, if such an ancestor exists (see the <html> transform check
  //     below — this is exactly what was happening: <html> had `transform: matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0)`,
  //     a literal identity matrix, but still a non-'none' computed value, and with no height in
  //     normal flow once <body> itself became position:fixed, `inset:0`/`bottom:24px`-style
  //     math against THAT collapsed box was landing off-screen). vw/vh sidesteps the whole
  //     containing-block question.
  //  2. An explicit numeric `z-index` (not `auto`) on this SAME element. `position:fixed` with
  //     `z-index:auto` still creates a stacking context, but it's placed in the "z-index 0 /
  //     auto" painting layer, ordered by DOM position among ties in THAT layer — apparently not
  //     reliably enough above <body>'s own same-layer stacking context in practice. An explicit
  //     positive z-index moves it into the strictly-higher "positive z-index" painting layer,
  //     which outranks the auto/0 layer unconditionally, regardless of DOM order.
  // Append to <body> (not <html>) — on mobile ST themes, <body> is position:fixed
  // and browsers elevate it to a special viewport-layer above <html>'s other
  // children when <html> has a transform. Being INSIDE <body> lets our z-index
  // compete within <body>'s stacking context instead of losing to <body> itself.
  // Every actual UI element inside (.wb-fab, .pm-panel, the mobile drawers/sheets, etc.) is
  // `position:absolute` in main.css, not `fixed` — they resolve against THIS single positioned,
  // viewport-sized anchor, so there's only one stacking-context boundary to reason about instead
  // of one per element (each of which would otherwise have had to independently win the same
  // fight against <body> that this element now wins once).

  el.style.pointerEvents = 'none' // covers the full screen at all times now — see main.css's
  // pointer-events:auto on .wb-fab/.pm-panel/.pm-var-popup, the only parts of this that are
  // ever actually visible, so clicks anywhere else on the host page still reach it normally.

  // One-time diagnostic: vw/vh sizing above already keeps this correctly sized regardless of
  // <html>'s transform, and top:0/left:0 lands correctly as long as that transform doesn't
  // actually translate anything (an identity matrix, a scale, a rotation about the origin, etc.
  // are all fine). The one case this DOESN'T cover is <html> being translated by a real, nonzero
  // amount — that would still offset top:0/left:0 away from the true viewport corner. Log it so
  // a future "FAB is offset in this host" report has an actual lead instead of starting from
  // zero again.
