 * Macro-boundary-anchored diff between `raw` (author-written block content, WITH its `{{}}`
 * macros still in place) and `rendered` (the real ST-rendered text for that block). This is the
 * primary entry point for precise-preview highlighting now — see wordDiff's own doc comment for
 * the three rounds of token-level fixes it went through, all of which turned out to share one
 * root cause that this function sidesteps entirely instead of patching further:
 *
 * wordDiff's patience-diff anchoring can only ever trust a token as an anchor if that exact
 * token occurs EXACTLY ONCE in the whole block, globally. That assumption quietly breaks down on
 * real preset blocks, which are full of short, highly-repeated tokens — a single space, a lone
 * `-`, `<`/`>` from pseudo-XML wrapper tags repeated once per section, whitespace runs from
 * list-item indentation repeated once per bullet. None of those can ever be trusted anchors, so
 * whole neighborhoods of the diff fall through to plain local LCS, which is free to "borrow" a
 * same-looking token from the wrong place nearby. Visually this showed up as the highlight
 * boundary drifting by one token: swallowing the space before a substituted value, losing the
 * newline+indent after it, or slicing the leading `<` off a closing tag like `</纪录方式>` — all
 * reported independently but all the same class of bug.
 *
 * This function never needs global token uniqueness in the first place. We already know exactly
 * where every macro sits in `raw` (that's what splitByMacros gives us), so `raw` decomposes into
 * literal text segments L0, {{M0}}, L1, {{M1}}, ..., Ln — and because ST substitutes macros
 * in-place, `rendered` is expected to look like L0, expand(M0), L1, expand(M1), ..., Ln with the
 * Li segments carried over VERBATIM. So instead of a global bag-of-tokens comparison, we walk the
 * Li segments in order and locate each one as an exact substring of `rendered`, searching forward
 * from a cursor that only ever advances. A local, sequential search needs no global uniqueness
 * guarantee at all — just "does this segment's text re-occur before the next one does", which
 * holds even when the very same short separator (e.g. a repeated `\n - ` list bullet) appears
 * many times in the block, because we only ever look for the NEXT occurrence after the cursor,
 * never any occurrence anywhere. Whatever lies between two consecutive anchors is, by
 * construction, exactly that macro's expansion — highlighted as one uninterrupted span, with no
 * risk of a token from elsewhere in the block leaking in and punching a hole through it.
 *
 * Falls back to the token-level wordDiff in two cases: no macros at all in `raw` (nothing to
 * anchor on — e.g. pure regex/extension substitution with no `{{}}` involved), or a literal
 * segment that can't be found verbatim (a macro like `{{trim}}` ate some of its neighboring
 * whitespace, or another plugin altered the literal text too) — retried once with the segment's
 * own leading/trailing whitespace trimmed off before giving up and falling back to a local
 * wordDiff for just that stretch.

/**
 * Word-level diff between `a` (raw, author-written block content) and `b` (the real

 * which parts of the rendered text are the *result* of substitution rather than literal
 * boilerplate that was already there — the ST render only gives us final text with no markers
 * of what changed, so this reconstructs an approximation.
 *
 * Returns `b` as a sequence of {text, added} runs: `added: false` runs are tokens that matched
 * something in `a` (kept verbatim, in order); `added: true` runs are tokens present in `b` but
 * not matched from `a` (macro output, regex-inserted text, etc). Tokens only in `a` (removed by
 * rendering, e.g. a `{{trim}}` macro eating the newline after it) are simply dropped — `b` is
 * ground truth for what to display, `a` only exists to tell added text apart from kept text.
 *
 * This is a heuristic, not a semantic diff: it can't know a plugin transformed "foo" into "bar"
 * vs. coincidentally matched tokens elsewhere. It's meant for "does this look substituted",
 * not a byte-exact provenance trace.
 *
 * Tokenization: plain whitespace-delimited "words" fall apart badly on CJK/punctuation-dense
 * text, because there are no spaces between "words" to split on — a whole clause like
 * `|对'{{user}}'怀有爱护` is ONE token, so as soon as `{{user}}` resolves to something else the
 * entire clause reads as "changed" and gets highlighted wholesale, when really only the 3
 * substituted characters should be. So tokens are: whitespace runs, OR runs of ASCII
 * letters/digits/underscore (keeps English words/macro output like "FTW" atomic instead of
 * shattering them into single letters), OR any other single character on its own (CJK
 * ideographs, punctuation, quotes, emoji, ...). That lets the diff align at per-character
 * resolution through CJK text while still treating Latin words as whole units.
 *
 * Matching strategy: plain LCS on that token stream turns out not to be enough on its own.
 * Repeated short tokens are everywhere in this kind of text — `<`/`>` from custom pseudo-XML
 * wrappers, CJK punctuation, quote marks — and whenever several equally-short-distance candidates
 * exist, a plain LCS DP will happily settle on WHICHEVER maximum-length alignment it finds first,
 * which is "valid" by the letter of longest-common-subsequence but not necessarily the one a
 * human reading the two texts side by side would consider correct — e.g. matching a `<` deep
 * inside one substituted value against an unrelated `<` several lines away, instead of the `<`
 * that actually belongs to the closing tag right next to it. That shows up as a stray
 * unhighlighted character (or a whole tag) punched out of the middle of what should read as one
 * continuous highlighted span, or — worse — a literal, unchanged tag like `</纪录方式>` reading as
 * partly "substituted" because its own `<` got stolen by a wrong match elsewhere.
 *
 * So matching is done in two tiers:
 *  1. Patience-style anchoring (diffRange): tokens that occur EXACTLY ONCE on both sides are
 *     unambiguous — there's only one thing they could possibly correspond to. Take the longest
 *     increasing (order-preserving) subsequence of those as trusted sync points, then recurse on
 *     the gaps between them. This is what correctly threads the needle between two genuinely
 *     identical structural tags even when there are many other repeated tokens in between.
 *  2. Plain LCS (lcsAtoms) as the base case, only ever run on whatever's left AFTER anchoring —
 *     i.e. small stretches already boxed in by trusted anchors on both sides (or the whole input,
 *     if it has no unique tokens at all to anchor on, which only happens for very short/highly
 *     repetitive spans where an O(n*m) DP is cheap anyway).
 * A final noise-collapse pass folds any short (< MIN_TRUSTED_RUN tokens) matched run that came
 * from tier 2 and is sandwiched between two highlighted runs back into the highlight — even with
 * anchoring, a small leftover gap can still occasionally resolve to a coincidental single-token
 * match rather than a meaningful one.

/**
 * Shared plain/ctrl/shift multi-select semantics — one click model used both by the main
 * editor's block list (Sidebar.vue, via presetStore's selectBlock) and CopyPanel.vue's two
 * independent block lists, so the two don't drift out of sync with each other over time.
 *
 * `id` is whatever the caller uses to identify a selectable row (a numeric flatNodes index for
 * the main sidebar, a string block identifier for CopyPanel). `all` is every selectable id in
 * the list's current on-screen order — only needed for the shift-range case, to walk from the
 * anchor to the clicked row in visual order rather than doing raw Math.min/max arithmetic on the
 * ids themselves (which only happens to work when ids ARE consecutive integers, as in the
 * original gi-index-based sidebar implementation; CopyPanel's string identifiers aren't).
 *
 * Semantics (mirrors the original presetStore selectBlock() exactly):
 *  - plain click: if this is the only currently-selected row, clicking it again clears the
 *    selection entirely; otherwise the selection becomes just this row, which also becomes the
 *    new anchor.
 *  - ctrl+click: toggles this row in/out of the existing selection; becomes the new anchor
 *    either way (even when the click just removed it).
 *  - shift+click: requires an existing anchor (a no-op otherwise) — selects every row between
 *    the anchor and this one, inclusive, in `all`'s order. The anchor itself doesn't move, so
 *    repeated shift-clicks keep extending/shrinking the range from the same fixed start point.
 *
 * Pure/no mutation — callers assign the returned state back to their own refs, which works
 * equally well from a Pinia store action or a plain component-local ref.
